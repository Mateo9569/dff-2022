# qml file manipulation

We should look to see what the qml files look like so we can manipulate them with data like comments downloaded from `bcdata` and from custom csv files that could hold the info we want to turn into forms.

<br>

Let's try loading one with only the `form` exported and inspect.

```{r}
my_data <- read.delim("data/survey_form_only.qml")

my_data %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable()
```
